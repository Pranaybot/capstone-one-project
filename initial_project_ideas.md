# Project Ideas

In this file (but not restricted to), you can use to get used to working on this repository and jot down project ideas to easily be shared with your mentors and to keep the history of!

1. I would like to use an API that can look for threats when it scans submitted documents/files and 
   enable the user to use antivirus software or convert them to another format to make them more
   secure and performant.
   
2. I would like to build an app similar to Trello that can help users organize and prioritize projects and connect to
   AI chatbots like ChatGPT to create different organizational templates according to the user's needs.
   
3. I would like also like to build an API that displays worldwide holidays like Caledarific API but also give meaningful
   information about each one by linking each holiday to sites like Wikipedia and show how each country has changed
   culturally over time.
